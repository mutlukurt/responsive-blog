# Modern Typography in UI

Designing readable and elegant interfaces starts with typography.

## Establish hierarchy

Use clear heading levels and comfortable line-height.

> Good typography improves comprehension and reduces cognitive load.

## Pair fonts thoughtfully

Choose a strong sans-serif for UI and a legible mono for code.

### Spacing

Whitespace guides attention and builds rhythm.

> Info: Use a consistent spacing scale across components.
